## üìà macOS Stats

A macOS monitoring tool that collects and displays detailed system information, resource usage, and hardware activity in real time.

This project was developed as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for a system monitoring agent by [Almaden LTDA](https://almaden.ai/).  
It utilizes native macOS APIs such as `sysctl`, `host_info`, and `IOKit` to collect low-level and high-level system data efficiently.
